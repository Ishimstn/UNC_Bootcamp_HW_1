### UNC_Bootcamp_HW_1
The Homework Assignment for Week 1 of the UNC Bootcamp focused on a webpage's accessbility and replacing HTML tag elements with semantic elements to make it easier to read through code and for the search engine to easily identify the layout of the HTML structure. Changes were also made to the style.css file to accomadate the semantic tag element structure.

### What I learned 
I was able to effectively change the basic HTML tag elements and implement semantic tag elements to make the code itself easier to read and to allow the webpage to also read it easily. I was able to add alternate attributes to image elements, replace div tag with section, header, and footer tag. The changes made in the HTML structure were also replicated and coded carefully into the style.css file in the assets folder to accomadate the changes. 

### Challenges 
I still found some challenges in styling in the css portion of the assignment. My footer tag for the HTML and CSS file did not match up in the actual deployment of the webpage and it was positioned wrong
